# DataDrivenTesting_loginpage_authoringEngine
I have created a script using python, Selenium for testing the login page of Authoring engine which needs email and password as input data from Excel Sheet.
so, when i run this script it will open the application in browser and start giving inputs to the login page from excel sheet
if the data is correct it will get logged into application and give status as PASS in excel sheet wiith respective to that particular credential data
if the data is incorrect it will give status as FAIL in excel sheet with respective to that particular credential data.
